<h1>Rate limit</h1>
<p1>Rate limiting is a good way for decreasing heavy traffic on our system with preventing bad bots to scrap it.</p>
<p>This is a very simple solution to add rate limiter based on endpoints path and user ip, we can also set it based on roles which we have in our system(admin, admin2, normal user, etc)</p>
